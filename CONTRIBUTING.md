## Development Guidelines

### Project Structure

See [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for detailed structure information.

### Adding New Cursor Rules

1. Create rule in `.cursor/rules/your-rule.mdc`
2. Use frontmatter:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Brief description
   alwaysApply: true
   ---

   # Your Rule Content
   ```
3. Test the rule with actual Cursor usage
4. Document in `docs/framework/rules.md`

### Adding Documentation

1. Place docs in appropriate `docs/` subdirectory
2. Update `mkdocs.yml` navigation
3. Follow existing formatting style
4. Test with `mkdocs serve`

### Updating Automation

1. **Git hooks** (`lefthook.yml`):
   - Keep hooks fast (<5 seconds)
   - Only run on relevant files
   - Document in `docs/automation/git-hooks.md`

2. **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/`):
   - Test workflows in your fork first
   - Keep jobs focused and parallel
   - Add comments explaining complex steps

## Review Process

1. **Automated checks must pass**:
   - Commit message format
   - Code formatting (Prettier)
   - Documentation build

2. **Maintainer review**:
   - Code quality and style
   - Documentation completeness
   - Alignment with project goals

3. **Merging**:
   - Squash commits for clean history
   - Update CHANGELOG.md (via Changesets)

## Release Process

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning:
