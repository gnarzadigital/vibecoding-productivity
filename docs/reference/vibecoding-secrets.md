# The Top 10 Vibecoding Secrets: AI-Native Development Framework

**Vibecoding isn't just using AI to write code** - it's programming the AI itself to be a reliable co-developer. These are the insider frameworks, project structures, and rules that separate casual prompt engineers from 10x AI-native builders.

## 1. The Plan-Then-Act mandate (non-negotiable)

**The mistake everyone makes**: Letting AI generate code immediately.

**The pro pattern**: Always force a two-phase workflow.

**Phase 1 - Planning with code embargo:**
```
Implement JWT authentication with Supabase profiles.

CRITICAL: First, present a detailed step-by-step plan including:
1. Supabase setup (tables, RLS policies)
2. Frontend components needed
3. API routes needed
4. State management approach
5. Specific files to create/modify
6. Potential challenges

DO NOT WRITE CODE YET. Wait for my "Proceed" command.
```

**Phase 2 - Execution:**
- Review the plan carefully
- Iterate until it's right
- Give explicit permission: "Plan approved. Proceed with implementation."

**Why it works**: Eliminates 70% of wasted AI-generated code that misunderstands requirements.

## 2. The sacred project trinity: PLANNING.md, TASK.md, .cursorrules

Professional vibe coders structure projects with three core files:

### PLANNING.md - The project brain
```markdown
# Vision
AI task manager for developer side projects

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase, Zustand, Tailwind

## Architecture Principles
- Modular structure by feature
- Server Components by default
- No files >500 lines

## Core Features
1. Task CRUD with drag-drop
2. AI-generated task breakdowns
3. Pomodoro integration

## Current Phase
Phase 2: AI features (current)
```

### TASK.md - Sequential execution checklist
```markdown
# Sprint: AI Task Generation

## Completed
- [x] Supabase tables setup
- [x] Auth flow complete

## In Progress
- [ ] Create /api/ai/breakdown endpoint
  - [ ] Integrate OpenAI API
  - [ ] Add loading states
  - [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Add task templates

## Future
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
```

### .cursorrules - AI behavioral programming

**Modern approach** - `.cursor/rules/` directory with modular `.mdc` files:

`.cursor/rules/core.mdc`:
```markdown
---
description: Core project rules
alwaysApply: true
---

# Context Loading
ALWAYS start by reading:
- @PLANNING.md - project context
- @TASK.md - current tasks

# Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode
- No 'any' types
- Files <500 lines
- Feature-based folders
```

`.cursor/rules/scope-control.mdc`:
```markdown
---
description: Prevent AI scope creep
alwaysApply: true
---

# Strict Scope Rules
- Only modify files directly related to current task
- NO unsolicited refactoring/cleanup
- If changing >1 file, list them and get approval first
```

`.cursor/rules/task-execution.mdc`:
```markdown
---
description: Task workflow
---

# Task Execution Protocol
1. Read @TASK.md
2. Execute FIRST unchecked item only
3. After completing step: change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
4. Announce completion
5. Wait for next instruction
```

**Impact**: Creates persistent AI memory across sessions. The AI always knows your project context, constraints, and current work.

---

## 3. Micro-tasks, micro-commits (the reliability rhythm)

**The pattern**:
1. Define smallest possible next step
2. Prompt AI for only that micro-task
3. AI generates minimal code
4. YOU verify thoroughly (compile, test, review)
5. Commit immediately if correct: `git commit -m "feat: add email validation"`
6. Repeat

**Why it's critical**: Creates instant rollback points, makes code review manageable, isolates errors immediately.

**Example micro-task sequence**:
```
Task: "Add email validation to signup"
├─ Micro 1: "Add email regex validation to form"
├─ Micro 2: "Add visual error state for invalid email"
├─ Micro 3: "Add server-side email validation"
└─ Micro 4: "Add email validation tests"
```

---

## 4. Ruthless revert policy - abandon AI debugging spirals

**The trap**: AI makes mistake → you correct → it breaks something else → you explain again → different bug → spiral continues.

**The pro move**: Recognize the spiral early (usually after 2-3 back-and-forths) and **immediately abandon**.

**The workflow**:
1. STOP prompting
2. Revert: `git reset --hard HEAD~1` (back to last good commit)
3. Analyze why AI failed
4. Break task smaller or clarify prompt
5. Retry from known good state

**Time saved**: 20-40 minutes per failed attempt vs endless debugging.

---

## 5. Self-improving rules loop (meta-skill)

**The game-changer**: Train the AI to maintain its own rules based on your corrections.

**The feedback cycle**:
1. AI makes error (uses `var` instead of `const`)
2. You correct: "Use `const` or `let`, never `var`. Refactor this."
3. AI fixes code
4. **Prompt for rule update**: "Based on this correction, update `.cursor/rules/javascript-style.mdc` to enforce using `const`/`let` instead of `var` for all future code."
5. AI updates its own rules

**Reinforcement example**:
"The custom error class pattern you used here is perfect. **Write a new rule in `.cursor/rules/error-handling.mdc`** defining this as our standard."

**Result**: The AI progressively learns your project-specific patterns and becomes more aligned over time.

---

## 6. Context file hierarchy (for large projects)

For projects beyond 10k lines, split `Documentation.md` into granular files:

```
docs/
├── api/
│   ├── AuthService.md
│   ├── PaymentGateway.md
├── database/
│   ├── Schema_Orders.md
│   ├── Schema_Users.md
├── architecture/
│   ├── DataFlow.md
│   ├── StateManagement.md
├── features/
│   ├── CheckoutProcess.md
│   └── SearchFeature.md
```

**Usage**: Reference only relevant files in prompts:
```
"Refactor checkout according to @docs/features/CheckoutProcess.md,
using API from @docs/api/OrderService.md"
```

---

## 7. The AI memory bank (persistent learnings)

**Problem**: AI forgets project-specific quirks, workarounds, gotchas between sessions.

**Solution**: Create `AI_MEMORY.md` for persistent knowledge:

```markdown
# AI Memory Bank

## Library Workarounds
### Library X Cache Bug
- **Issue**: Library X v1.2 cache doesn't invalidate after operation Y
- **Workaround**: Manually call `LibraryX.clearCache('key')` after Y
- **Date**: 2024-07-26
- **See**: #issue-123

## Deployment Quirks
### Vercel Environment Variables
- Must prefix client vars with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- Redeploy needed after env var changes
- **Always** check build logs for env warnings

## Browser Quirks
### Safari Rendering Bug
- Safari needs forced reflow after state updates
- Solution: `element.offsetHeight` after component update
```

**Rule to auto-maintain**:
```markdown
# Rule: When discovering project-specific learning, workaround,
# or gotcha, add entry to @AI_MEMORY.md with:
# - Issue description
# - Workaround/solution
# - Date and reference
```

---

## 8. Strategic model selection by task

**Don't use one model for everything**. Choose by task:

**Complex reasoning/planning** → GPT-4o, Claude Opus, Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Initial planning (Trick #1)
- Architecture decisions
- Complex bug debugging

**Code implementation** → Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o
- Generating code from approved plans
- Refactoring
- Test writing

**Quick iterations** → Claude 3.7 Sonnet (thinking)
- Fast feedback loops
- Minor fixes

**Pro tip**: If one model fails, try the exact same prompt with a different model. Different training data can unlock solutions.

---

## 9. Community rule templates (don't reinvent the wheel)

**Top resources**:

**How to use**:
1. Find relevant rule for your stack
2. Copy to `.cursor/rules/framework-name.mdc`
3. **Customize** for your specific project
4. Test and iterate

**Don't just copy** - adapt rules to match your:
- Project conventions
- Team preferences
- Specific constraints
- Performance requirements

---

## 10. The vibecoding workflow (putting it all together)

**Project setup (once)**:
1. Create `PLANNING.md` with vision, tech stack, architecture
2. Create `TASK.md` with current sprint tasks
3. Set up `.cursor/rules/` with core rules:
   - `core.mdc` (always read PLANNING.md, TASK.md)
   - `scope-control.mdc` (prevent AI scope creep)
   - `task-execution.mdc` (sequential checkbox workflow)
   - `[framework].mdc` (framework-specific rules from cursor.directory)
4. Create `AI_MEMORY.md` for learnings

**Daily workflow**:
```
Morning:
├─ Review @TASK.md
├─ Pick first unchecked task
└─ Break into micro-tasks

For each micro-task:
├─ 1. Prompt for PLAN (no code)
├─ 2. Review plan, iterate
├─ 3. Approve: "Proceed"
├─ 4. AI implements
├─ 5. YOU verify (compile, test)
├─ 6. Commit if good
└─ 7. Update TASK.md checkbox

If AI struggles (>2 corrections):
├─ STOP immediately
├─ Revert: git reset --hard HEAD~1
├─ Break task smaller
└─ Retry with clearer prompt

End of day:
├─ Update PLANNING.md with decisions
├─ Log any quirks to AI_MEMORY.md
└─ Push clean commit history
```

---

## Advanced vibecoding patterns

### Pattern: Force explicit reasoning
```markdown
# In .cursor/rules/reasoning.mdc:
When choosing between implementation approaches,
add comment explaining:
- Chosen approach
- Alternatives considered
- Rationale

Example:
/* REASONING: Using approach X over Y because
   project guidelines prioritize simplicity over
   performance for this data size */
```

### Pattern: No-hallucination verification
```markdown
# In prompts:
"If you're uncertain about any API or syntax,
STOP and ask me to verify before proceeding.
Never guess or hallucinate function signatures."
```

### Pattern: Multi-file change approval
```markdown
# In .cursor/rules/scope-control.mdc:
If request requires changing >1 file:
1. List all files that will be modified
2. Wait for explicit "Proceed" approval
3. Then make changes
```

### Pattern: Changelog automation
```markdown
# In .cursor/rules/changelog.mdc:
After every code change, update CHANGELOG.md:
- Add entry to [Unreleased] section
- Use format: `- [Category] Description (#PR)`
- Follow Semantic Versioning
```

## Common vibecoding anti-patterns (avoid these)

**❌ Don't**: Let AI generate without planning
**✓ Do**: Always Plan-Then-Act (Trick #1)

**❌ Don't**: Make big changes in one prompt
**✓ Do**: Use micro-tasks + micro-commits (Trick #3)

**❌ Don't**: Debug AI errors endlessly
**✓ Do**: Revert after 2-3 failed corrections (Trick #4)

**❌ Don't**: Use same model for everything
**✓ Do**: Match model to task complexity (Trick #8)

**❌ Don't**: Let AI touch files outside task scope
**✓ Do**: Enforce strict scope rules (Trick #2)

**❌ Don't**: Accept AI code without verification
**✓ Do**: Verify, test, review every change

**❌ Don't**: Start new projects without structure
**✓ Do**: Set up PLANNING.md, TASK.md, rules first

## Cursor vs Windsurf: which for vibecoding?

**Cursor** (recommended for most)
- Best for: Developers wanting control and precision
- Strengths: Better manual context control, Claude 4 access, advanced debugging
- Weakness: Slightly steeper learning curve
- Price: $20/month

**Windsurf** (recommended for speed)
- Best for: Rapid prototyping, smaller projects
- Strengths: Faster out-of-box experience, automatic context, cheaper
- Weakness: Can be overconfident with multi-file changes
- Price: $15/month

**Both support**: The same `.cursorrules`/`.windsurfrules` format, same rule patterns, same workflows.

**Pro tip**: Use Cursor for production work, Windsurf for quick experiments.

## Measuring vibecoding success

**Track these metrics**:
- **Successful AI generations on first try** (target: >70%)
- **Reverts needed per feature** (target: <2)
- **Lines of AI code kept vs deleted** (target: >80% kept)
- **Time to feature completion** (measure baseline, aim for 3-5x improvement)

**Red flags** (you're doing it wrong):
- More than 3 prompt iterations per micro-task
- Frequently reverting due to AI misunderstandings
- Spending more time fixing AI code than writing from scratch
- AI frequently touching wrong files
- Inconsistent code quality

**Green flags** (you're nailing it):
- AI understands requirements on first try
- Commits are small and atomic
- Code quality consistently high
- Rare need for major refactoring
- Smooth handoff between you and AI

---

## The vibecoding mindset shift

**Traditional coding**: You write every line
**Vibecoding**: You architect, AI implements, you verify

**Your new role**:
- **Architect**: Define structure, patterns, tech choices
- **Lead**: Guide AI through clear instructions and rules
- **QA**: Verify every change ruthlessly
- **Mentor**: Teach AI project patterns through rules

**AI's role**:
- Fast implementation of clear specs
- Boilerplate generation
- Test writing
- Documentation

**Critical**: You're not becoming less technical - you're becoming a force multiplier by mastering AI collaboration patterns.
