### 4. Framework-Specific Templates

#### React/Next.js (react-rules.mdc)
- Component standards and patterns
- Hook patterns and state management
- Performance optimization
- Testing patterns

#### Vue.js (vue-rules.mdc)
- Composition API standards
- Component structure
- State management with Pinia
- Testing patterns

#### Python/FastAPI (python-rules.mdc)
- FastAPI patterns and standards
- Database patterns with SQLAlchemy
- Error handling and testing
- Async patterns

#### Node.js/Express (nodejs-rules.mdc)
- Express patterns and middleware
- Service layer architecture
- Database models and testing
- Environment configuration

### 5. Development Workflow Templates

#### Git Workflow (git-workflow.mdc)
- Branch naming conventions
- Commit message standards
- Micro-commit strategy
- Release workflow

#### Deployment (deployment.mdc)
- Docker configuration
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Health checks and monitoring
- Security headers and rollback strategy

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. Plan-Then-Act Mandate
- **Never** let AI generate code immediately
- **Always** present detailed plans first
- **Wait** for explicit approval before coding
- **Eliminates** 70% of wasted AI-generated code

### 2. Micro-Task Execution
- Break tasks into 5-15 minute chunks
- Commit after each successful micro-task
- Create instant rollback points
- Maintain atomic changes

### 3. Self-Improving Rules
- AI updates its own rules based on corrections
- Builds project-specific patterns over time
- Creates persistent institutional knowledge
- Improves AI alignment with project needs

### 4. Scope Control
- Prevent AI from touching unrelated files
- Require approval for multi-file changes
- Maintain focus on current task
- Eliminate scope creep

### 5. Quality Assurance
- TypeScript strict mode enforcement
- Comprehensive error handling
- Testing standards and patterns
- Code quality gates

## üìä Success Metrics

### Track These KPIs
- **Successful AI generations on first try** (target: >70%)
- **Reverts needed per feature** (target: <2)
- **Lines of AI code kept vs deleted** (target: >80% kept)
- **Time to feature completion** (aim for 3-5x improvement)

### Red Flags (You're Doing It Wrong)
- More than 3 prompt iterations per micro-task
- Frequently reverting due to AI misunderstandings
- Spending more time fixing AI code than writing from scratch
- AI frequently touching wrong files

### Green Flags (You're Nailing It)
- AI understands requirements on first try
- Commits are small and atomic
- Code quality consistently high
- Rare need for major refactoring

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Copy framework to your project
cp -r vibecoding-productivity/* your-project/

# Customize for your project
# Edit PLANNING.md with your details
# Edit TASK.md with your first sprint
# Update .cursor/rules/ for your tech stack
```

### 2. Daily Workflow
1. **Morning**: Review `@TASK.md` and `@PLANNING.md`
2. **Pick Task**: Choose first unchecked item
3. **Plan First**: Present detailed implementation plan
4. **Get Approval**: Wait for "Proceed" command
5. **Implement**: Follow approved plan exactly
6. **Verify**: Test and commit if successful
7. **Update**: Mark task complete in `@TASK.md`

### 3. Emergency Protocols
- **Stop** after 2-3 failed corrections
- **Revert** to last good commit
- **Analyze** why AI failed
- **Break task smaller** and retry
